          I run operations as a General Manager at a LiveChat company named "Xtreme Online Solutions Pvt. Ltd." - been leading our team for about 7 years now. Most of my day involves making sure our chat systems are actually helping businesses connect with their customers.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What I Do:</h2>
        <p>
          I lead our operations team, which means I am responsible for making sure businesses get reliable, smooth chat support. The technical side keeps me engaged, but what really drives me is seeing how the right tools can transform a customer's experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under my leadership, we've increased customer satisfaction scores by 18% while reducing our average response times. Our AI implementation has allowed us to handle 3x the conversation volume with the same team size, resulting in a 30% reduction in cost-per-interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been diving deeper into AI integration lately. Not just because it's trendy, but because I've seen firsthand how it helps our agents handle more complex issues while automating the routine stuff. We've managed to cut response times while actually improving satisfaction scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Process optimization is probably where I spend most of my mental energy, finding those inefficiencies that slow teams down and fixing them systematically.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">My AI Interest:</h2>
        <p>
          Outside work hours, I'm usually testing new AI tools that might improve our platform. Started as a professional necessity but turned into something of a hobby. I'm particularly interested in how we can make automation feel more human and helpful rather than robotic and frustrating.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters:</h2>
        <p>
          I believe we are finally reaching a point where technology can enhance human connection in customer service rather than replace it. The challenge is finding that balance using AI for speed and consistency while keeping the empathy that only humans can provide.
        </p>

          I am always eager to exchange insights with my collegues working to elevate customer service through technology. Beyond the success stories, I have accumulated a treasure trove of valuable lessons from challenging implementations that I am happy to share.
